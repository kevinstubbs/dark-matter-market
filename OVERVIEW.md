Agentkit, A2A
- Briber: choose a DMM, proposal, voting outcome. Choose maximum spend.
- Bribee: choose DMM, dictate in natural language what they are for or against.
Agents continuously running to rebalance, scrounge up enough votes to meet their outcome, adapt based on how the market may be changing.

The price for votes should ALWAYS be significantly less than the actual cost of the token (otherwise, just buy the token instead.)

Your bribe rewards can be automatically swept to a Bonzo vault to keep earning OR (easier) automatically buy more tokens with your rewards, so your position just automatically grows over time.
